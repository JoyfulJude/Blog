            <p>If you are attached to the idea “once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic” this blog may be upsetting! There is a method that uses alcohol to cure problematic alcohol use. It is called The Sinclair Method (TSM). It uses a medication called naltrexone COMBINED with alcohol to cure "alcoholism". 
            </p>
            <p>
            I write this article from experience. I do <strong>not</strong> recommend anyone rushing to try this without doing their own 
    <a href="https://cthreefoundation.org/the-sinclair-method" target="_blank">research</a>
             to see if it is a good fit for their  lives (mixing naltrexone with narcotics could lead to overdose, coma, or death).

            My healing journey started in 2019 when I saw this YouTube 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EghiY_s2ts" target="_blank">video</a>.        
            To be fair, it actually started when I was called out in a very public way for boozing with breakfast and lunch! At the time, I woke with sever shaking and needed a glug of vodka to be functional until lunchtime where I would need more to stave off the shakes until dinner time. Only then, with enough alcohol, could I briefly convince myself that everything was okay. 
            </p>
            <p>
            It was not ok. And it was not sustainable. But quitting on my own was physically dangerous and emotionally daunting.  
            </p>
            <p>
            When faced with physical dependency, a medical detox is imperative to prevent potential seizures, delirium, or even 
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482134/" target="_blank">death</a>.
            For anyone in driving distance of Kamloops, 
    <a href="https://www.dayonesociety.ca/detoxprogram" target="_blank">The Phoenix Center</a>        
             is a life saver! It is free for ANYONE needing medically assisted detoxification from ANYTHING. There I was introduced to naltrexone which lead me to discovering The Sinclair Method (TSM).

            A person can still get drunk and have fun but the brain starts interacting with the alcohol differently. For me, it turned me into a "normal" drinker. I would have a few drinks, then not want any more and eat instead!    
            </p>
            <p>
            The duration of this method varies among individuals and hinges on their definition of success. Achieving complete abstinence may take anywhere from a few months to a few years, and the process is far from linear. It looks more like this:

            <p>
            I simply wanted the ability to drink without ruining my life! By that measure, it was successful almost instantly. With some ups and downs, I went from being physically dependent, to drinking casually, to weekend drinks, then every couple of weeks, and every couple of months, to not thinking much about it at all. As long as I have naltrexone with me, I can drink whenever I want. But I have lost the desire! Now it just sounds expensive financially, physically, and emotionally. I would rather sit back and enjoy saving my money and my sanity. <strong>I am no longer an "alcoholic"!</strong>
